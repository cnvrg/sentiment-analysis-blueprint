You can use this blueprint to immediately analyse sentiment in text.
For using this pretrained sentiment analysis model, you will need to create a ready-to-use API-endpoint that can be integrated with your data and application, in minutes.
1. Click on `Use Blueprint` button
2. In the pop up, choose the relevant compute you want to use to deploy your API endpoint
3. You will be redirected to your endpoint
4. You can use the `Try it Live` section with any text, i.e. "I love this blueprint"
5. You can also integrate your API with your code using the integration panel at the bottom of the page

Congrats! You have deployed an API endpoint that analyse sentiment in text!
